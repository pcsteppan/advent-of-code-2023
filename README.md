# Advent of Code 2023

## Summary
In 2023 I participated in Advent of Code (AoC) and completed 40/50 of the problems.


⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ __80%__



When possible I avoided brute-force algorithms, and always strived to figure out the best approach myself.
I'm happy with most of my solutions and the algorithms I discovered.

More over, I used this AoC as an opportunity to derust my Rust and also to start learning Vim.

## What I Picked Up
+ ⌨ Neovim setup for Rust development
+ 🦀 Experience with great Rust crates like Rayon and Petgraph
+ 🗺 Search algorithms and general traversal of data structures (there were a _ton_ of 2D array/graph data structures this year)
+ 🔁 Identifying where recursion simplfies implementations and identifying when memoization makes or breaks the solve time of a long problem

### What is Advent of Code?
> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
